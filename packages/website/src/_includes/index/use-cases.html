          A standardized application security baseline for vendor selection simplifies the sourcing team's job and
          provides a clear set of requirements for enterprise-ready products and services. MVSP is designed to be
          brief, concise, and easy to understand so that it can be included in RFP documents without causing delays.

          Smaller companies that are not yet mature enough to invest in large compliance efforts such as SOC 2 or PCI DSS
          can use MVSP as a baseline to measure the security posture of their MVP and create a roadmap for continuous
          improvement. An initial MVP often does not contain all of the necessary controls and protections. Therefore,
          it is critical to understand where security fits into the long-term roadmap in order to reach enterprise customers.

          To ensure the security posture of third-party suppliers, large companies can incorporate MVSP into their standard
          contractual controls. By ensuring that third-parties respond to the MVSP controls at the RFP stage, the process
          of agreeing contractual controls can be further expedited.
