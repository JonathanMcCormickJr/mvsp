      </part>
      <part id="AIS-04_imp_gui" name="implementation_guideline"><p>Defining security requirements should be the first step in the secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) process to ensure that security is integrated into the product from its creation. All security requirement aspects should be considered from functional, physical, and business requirements perspectives. In addition, security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process&#x2014;including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and end-of-life (EoL) processes.</p>
<p>To successfully enable SSDLC security, roles and expectations should be clearly defined and published, and an inventory of applications and their metadata should exist in an easily accessible format.</p>
<p>Appropriate security practice examples for the common stages of an SSDLC are provided below to include the following categories: training, requirements, design, development, testing, and release and response.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Training:</li>
  <li>Role-based secure development training should be required at multiple stages of employment (or other contractual relationships), including on-boarding and role changes.</li>
  <li>Refresher training should be delivered throughout one's career, regardless of position or movement in their organization.</li>
  <li>Targeted, specialty training should be created and made available as the organization adopts new technologies.</li>
  <li>Progressively advanced training should be made available to relevant employees (and contractors whenever applicable) as they transition through technical roles and/or champion program participants.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Requirements:</li>
  <li>Generic and specialized security requirements should be defined, published, organized, and easily accessible to all organizational roles.</li>
  <li>Every application, during each iteration, should review existing requirements and research if additional requirements are necessary. It is beneficial for the engineering teams to consult with a security professional at this time.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Design:</li>
  <li>Security-focused design reviews are conducted.</li>
  <li>Threat models are developed or modified.</li>
  <li>The design of new or enhanced security controls, required by the application design, is developed.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Development:</li>
  <li>Develop, as per design specifications.</li>
  <li>Abuse cases are used to develop a security-focused unit and integration tests during development.</li>
  <li>Secure coding practices are implemented and enforced through automation and manual peer code reviews.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Security Testing:</li>
  <li>Manual and automated test plans are developed and executed with abuse cases in mind.</li>
  <li>Automation may include one or more of SCA, SAST, DAST, IAST, fuzzing, credential scans, etc.</li>
  <li>Penetration testing may be executed during this stage, based on need.</li>
  <li>Crowdsourced testing or private bug bounty programs may be implemented.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Release:</li>
  <li>Change control is instituted, including gating and documenting releases to ensure requirements and compliance objectives are met.</li>

<p>Automation of security testing should be implemented to reduce risks and errors and enable the scaling of security practices to meet organizational demands. Multiple test types and integration points will likely be needed to provide the appropriate level of assurance throughout the SDLC. Criteria should be developed for use when assessing the automation required by an application, as not all systems will benefit equally.</p>
<p>Strategy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the goals and requirements of the automation implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security requirements are not relaxed to improve speed.</li>
  <li>All developers can leverage tools to detect security weaknesses while developing software.</li>
  <li>All third-party libraries are scanned for known vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>All authentication and authorization functions &#x201C;pass&#x201D; abuse case unit tests before deployment.</li>
  <li>All website security headers are verified to meet security requirements when deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Applicable programming languages should be supported by static analysis tools.</li>
  <li>Python and C# should be supported by select static analysis tools.</li>
  <li>Automation should not require infrastructure support.</li>
  <li>All automation tools should offer an application programming interface (API).</li>
  <li>All website security headers are verified to meet security requirements when deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy can also include, but is not limited to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Security testing for unintentional side effects and behaviors that are not specified in the test plan or design.</li>
  <li>Security testing for incident response procedures, such as simulating breaches.</li>
  <li>Determining which portfolio applications warrant investment in automation. Prioritize the adoption order based on criticality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Considerations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Security requirements</li>
  <li>Risk, business, and compliance requirements</li>
  <li>Development methodology</li>
  <li>Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Metrics establishment</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Count or percentage of (test type) adoption among applications requiring (test type) SAST, DAST, SCA, etc.</li>
  <li>Count or percentage of false positives produced by test automation.</li>
  <li>Count or percentage of execution-time SLA breaches by test automation.</li>
  <li>Soft measures, including satisfaction levels with usability.</li>
  <li>Change in the number of security weaknesses discovered after release.</li>
  <li>Percentage coverage of automated test cases for exposed APIs and SDK functions by service (i.e., the total number of automated test cases for APIs/SDK functions; the total number of APIs/SDK by service).</li>
  <li>Evaluate test types to determine which is best suited for different categories of applications based on the attributes of those in the prioritized inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development and security team sizes</li>
  <li>Platform and operating systems</li>
  <li>Maturity of build automation</li>
  <li>Language support</li>
</ul>
<p>Execution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoid approaches that cause unreasonable delays to builds and deployments or require significant process modification or resource commitment from development teams.</li>
  <li>Seek to adopt automation at multiple SDLC integration points</li>
</ol>
<p>Example integration points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cloud service provider implementation description: How the CSP meets (or doesn't meet) the controls they are responsible for, wholly or partially.

Malware protection should be integrated across all computing infrastructure, including compute, network, endpoints, and secure access gateways.</p>
<p>Organizations should centrally manage malware protection mechanisms, including planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring organizational-defined malware protection security controls. This process will help to cohesively address malware within predefined timeframes.</p>
<p>Threat and vulnerability management policy should include the ability to address malware as a specific threat element. This should provide the organization with a guideline to handle malware using appropriate tools, relevant automation, and operational frameworks to meet their risk tolerance.</p>
<p>If malware is identified by antivirus or anti-malware applications using a signature- or behavior-based detection process, malware removal should be updated according to applicable contractual agreements and organizational standards. Additionally, prevention software and associated signatures should be deployed centrally by the service provider throughout their environment.</p>

      <part id="UEM-08_imp_gui" name="implementation_guideline"><p>To minimize data leak risks and protect data stored on the endpoint device, use encryption. Encryption capabilities could be part of common endpoint solutions such as DLP, endpoint firewalls, and PAM. Additionally, they could be standalone (e.g., device container technology, file encryption, and full-disk encryption). The encryption strength should be based on the sensitivity of the data being protected.</p>
<p>Endpoint device policies should use encryption for the entire device or data identified as sensitive on all mobile devices (potentially using container technology). This policy should be enforced through technology controls.</p>

      </part>
      <part id="UEM-09_imp_gui" name="implementation_guideline"><p>Organizations should consider the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Managed endpoints should be protected through anti-malware software, security awareness, appropriate system access, and change management controls.</li>
  <li>Organizations should have formal policies and technologies implemented to install and upgrade protective measures promptly. These measures include installing and regularly updating anti-malware software and virus definitions (automatically) and whenever updates are available. Additionally, organizations should periodically review and scan installed software and system data content to identify and remove unauthorized software (when possible).</li>
  <li>Wherever possible, organizations should also:
  <ol>
    <li>Disable universal serial bus (USB) ports.</li>
    <li>Prohibit writable media use (e.g., DVD-R).</li>
    <li>Restrict read-only media (e.g., DVD-ROM) used to legitimate commercial sources for legitimate business reasons (e.g., Linux installation disks) and allow only whitelisted software to run on the endpoint.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Employ anti-malware software that offers a centralized infrastructure that compiles information on file reputations or has administrators manually push updates to all machines. After updating, automated systems should verify that each system has received its signature update.</li>
  <li>Define procedures to respond to malicious code or unauthorized software identification. Checking antivirus or anti-spyware software generates audit logs of checks performed. Malicious code detection and repair software checks to scan computers and media include:
  <ol>
    <li>Checking files on electronic or optical media and files received over networks for malicious code before use.</li>
    <li>Checking electronic mail attachments and downloads for malicious code or file types that are unnecessary for organizational business before use. This check occurs at different places (e.g., electronic mail servers, desktop computers, and when entering the organization&#x2019;s network).</li>
    <li>Checking web traffic&#x2014;such as hypertext markup language (HTML), JavaScript, and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)&#x2014;for malicious code.</li>
    <li>Checking removable media (e.g., USB tokens and hard drives, CDs/DVDs, FireWire devices, and external serial advanced technology attachment devices) when inserted.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Have formal policies to prohibit using or installing unauthorized software, including restricting on obtaining data and software from external networks. User awareness and training on these policies and methods should be provided for all users regularly.</li>
  <li>Bring your own device (BYOD) users should use anti-malware software (where supported).</li>

      </part>
      <part id="UEM-14_imp_gui" name="implementation_guideline"><p>The organization should perform due diligence before granting third party access to the organization's data or establishing connectivity (and periodically thereafter, commensurate with the risk level of the third-party relationship).</p>
<p>Written agreements (contracts) should be maintained and include an acknowledgment that the third party is responsible for the security of the data the third party possesses or otherwise stores, processes, or transmits on the organization&#x2019;s behalf. In addition, agreements should include requirements to address the information security risks associated with information and communications technology services (e.g., cloud computing services) and the product supply chain. These requirements are subsequently applicable to relevant, third-party (i.e., fourth parties)  subcontractors (and so on) throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p>Personnel security requirements should be established and documented&#x2014;including security roles and responsibilities for third-party providers coordinated and aligned with internal security roles and responsibilities. Monitor providers for compliance.</p>
<p>Additionally, the organization should have a screening process for contractors and third-party users. When organizations provide contractors, the contract should specify the organization's responsibilities for screening and relevant notification procedures if screening has not been completed (or if the results cause doubts or concerns). Similarly, third-party agreements should specify all responsibilities and notification procedures for screening.</p>
<p>Third-party providers should notify a designated individual or role (e.g., a member of the contracting or supply chain function) of any personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials, badges, or have information system privileges.</p>
<p>Formal contracts should be employed that, at a minimum, specify:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The covered information&#x2019;s confidential nature and value.</li>
  <li>The security measures to be implemented and/or complied with. These include the organization's information security requirements and appropriate controls required by applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidance, and third-party access limitations.</li>
  <li>The service levels to be achieved in the services provided.</li>
  <li>The format and frequency of reporting to the organization's information security management forum.</li>
  <li>The arrangement for representation of the third party in appropriate organizational meetings and working groups.</li>
  <li>The arrangements for third-party compliance auditing.</li>
  <li>The penalties exacted if any of the preceding specifications fail.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mutually agreed-upon provisions and/or terms should be established to satisfy customer (tenant) requirements for service-to-service application (API), information processing interoperability, portability for application development and information exchange, usage, and integrity persistence.</p>
