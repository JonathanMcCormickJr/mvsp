          Both the cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud service customer (CSC) should develop a "customized integrated framework" of audit and assurance policies and procedures. This framework should incorporate/demonstrate compliance to leading industry standards and self-imposed business requirements while providing appropriate coverage of controls to assess the respective cloud environment and corresponding services.At a minimum, audit and assurance policies and procedures should include:

          1. Audit and assurance functions indicating purposes, responsibilities, authorities, and accountabilities to ensure organizational independence, professional care, audit objectivity, and proficiency,
          2. Audit and assurance plans,
          3. Audit development policies and procedures to determine criteria and assertions against which the subject matter will be assessed, quality assurance and supervision, sufficient and appropriate evidence, in accordance with commonly accepted frameworks and audit best practices,
          4. Audit reporting to communicate audit results and findings,
          5. Follow-up activities to monitor audit findings implementation progress

          Actionable metrics should be defined with consideration to business goals, the criticality of service, security requirements, and compliance obligations.

          Example technical metrics include:

          - Count or percentage of vulnerabilities by weakness.
          - Count or percentage of vulnerabilities by severity.
          - Count or percentage of vulnerabilities by detection source (design review, code review, SAST, DAST, penetration test, VDP, or bug bounty).
          - Count or percentage of vulnerabilities by environment detected (pre-production vs. production).
          - Average time to resolution.
          - Count exceeding remediation service level objectives (SLOs).

          Example operational metrics include:

          - Count or percentage of applications using automated security testing by test type (SAST, DAST, SCA).
          - Count or percentage of applications have completed penetration testing in the last “n” months.
          - Count or percentage of development teams or individuals who have completed application security training in the last “n” months.
          - Count of proactive engagements by development and business teams.
          - Results from surveys delivered to application security customers, such as business and development teams.

          Reporting:

          Reporting should be designed with various users in mind. For example, security professionals, engineering teams, business stakeholders, and executives will often have different interests requiring specialized views, filtering, and delivery mechanisms.

          1. The collection, visualization, and distribution of reporting data should be automated.
          2. Data may be further analyzed using application criticality, business units, platforms, languages, and other factors relevant to the viewer.
          3. Compare actual metrics to standards to evaluate performance.
          4. Enable comparisons over time to identify trends.
          5. Enable correlations, such as relating a reduction in vulnerabilities of a specific type after new tools or training.

        name: implementation_guideline
        prose: |
          Defining security requirements should be the first step in the secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) process to ensure that security is integrated into the product from its creation. All security requirement aspects should be considered from functional, physical, and business requirements perspectives. In addition, security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process—including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and end-of-life (EoL) processes.

          To successfully enable SSDLC security, roles and expectations should be clearly defined and published, and an inventory of applications and their metadata should exist in an easily accessible format.

          Appropriate security practice examples for the common stages of an SSDLC are provided below to include the following categories: training, requirements, design, development, testing, and release and response.

          1. Training:
          2. Role-based secure development training should be required at multiple stages of employment (or other contractual relationships), including on-boarding and role changes.
          3. Refresher training should be delivered throughout one's career, regardless of position or movement in their organization.
          4. Targeted, specialty training should be created and made available as the organization adopts new technologies.
          5. Progressively advanced training should be made available to relevant employees (and contractors whenever applicable) as they transition through technical roles and/or champion program participants.

          1. Requirements:
          2. Generic and specialized security requirements should be defined, published, organized, and easily accessible to all organizational roles.
          3. Every application, during each iteration, should review existing requirements and research if additional requirements are necessary. It is beneficial for the engineering teams to consult with a security professional at this time.

          1. Design:
          2. Security-focused design reviews are conducted.
          3. Threat models are developed or modified.
          4. The design of new or enhanced security controls, required by the application design, is developed.

          1. Development:
          2. Develop, as per design specifications.
          3. Abuse cases are used to develop a security-focused unit and integration tests during development.
          4. Secure coding practices are implemented and enforced through automation and manual peer code reviews.

          1. Security Testing:
          2. Manual and automated test plans are developed and executed with abuse cases in mind.
          3. Automation may include one or more of SCA, SAST, DAST, IAST, fuzzing, credential scans, etc.
          4. Penetration testing may be executed during this stage, based on need.
          5. Crowdsourced testing or private bug bounty programs may be implemented.

          1. Release:
          2. Change control is instituted, including gating and documenting releases to ensure requirements and compliance objectives are met.

          1. Response:

          Note: The implementation guidelines of AIS-05 should be interpreted as further guidance in addition to what is specified in AIS-03 and AIS-04.

          Automation of security testing should be implemented to reduce risks and errors and enable the scaling of security practices to meet organizational demands. Multiple test types and integration points will likely be needed to provide the appropriate level of assurance throughout the SDLC. Criteria should be developed for use when assessing the automation required by an application, as not all systems will benefit equally.

          Strategy:

          1. Identify the goals and requirements of the automation implementation.

          Example goals:

          - Security requirements are not relaxed to improve speed.
          - All developers can leverage tools to detect security weaknesses while developing software.
          - All third-party libraries are scanned for known vulnerabilities.
          - All authentication and authorization functions “pass” abuse case unit tests before deployment.
          - All website security headers are verified to meet security requirements when deployed.

          Example requirements:

          - Applicable programming languages should be supported by static analysis tools.
          - Python and C# should be supported by select static analysis tools.
          - Automation should not require infrastructure support.
          - All automation tools should offer an application programming interface (API).
          - All website security headers are verified to meet security requirements when deployed.

          Strategy can also include, but is not limited to:

          1. Security testing for unintentional side effects and behaviors that are not specified in the test plan or design.
          2. Security testing for incident response procedures, such as simulating breaches.
          3. Determining which portfolio applications warrant investment in automation. Prioritize the adoption order based on criticality.

          Considerations:

          1. Security requirements
          2. Risk, business, and compliance requirements
          3. Development methodology
          4. Lifecycle
          5. Metrics establishment

          Example:

          - Count or percentage of (test type) adoption among applications requiring (test type) SAST, DAST, SCA, etc.
          - Count or percentage of false positives produced by test automation.
          - Count or percentage of execution-time SLA breaches by test automation.
          - Soft measures, including satisfaction levels with usability.
          - Change in the number of security weaknesses discovered after release.
          - Percentage coverage of automated test cases for exposed APIs and SDK functions by service (i.e., the total number of automated test cases for APIs/SDK functions; the total number of APIs/SDK by service).
          - Evaluate test types to determine which is best suited for different categories of applications based on the attributes of those in the prioritized inventory.

          Considerations:

          - Development and security team sizes
          - Platform and operating systems
          - Maturity of build automation
          - Language support

          Execution:

          1. Avoid approaches that cause unreasonable delays to builds and deployments or require significant process modification or resource commitment from development teams.
          2. Seek to adopt automation at multiple SDLC integration points

          Example integration points:

          1. A plugin in the developer's integrated development environment (IDE).
          2. Abuse case unit and integration tests—created and maintained by developers—and executed during development and build cycles.
          3. Static application security testing or SCA scans executed during automated builds.
          4. Dynamic application security testing scans executed during automated deployment.

          1. Automate patching when possible.
          2. Use metrics to drive feedback loops and continuous improvement.

          1. Maintain an accurate count of license utilization.
          2. Tune automation to reduce false positives and false negatives.
          3. Analyze gaps in support and trends for response and planning.

          1. Continue to leverage manual testing for scenarios not easily tested with automation.

          2. Communicate the business continuity and resilience policy, objectives, and plans to all relevant stakeholders.
          3. Communicate the roles, responsibilities, authorities, and expected competencies to all relevant stakeholders.
          4. Establish the criteria, thresholds, and indicators to demonstrate when and how business continuity-related communications should be sent, who should send them, and to whom they should be sent.
          5. Establish templates for common communications during a disruption regarding the activation, operation, coordination, and communication of a business continuity response.
          6. Establish the people, technology, and processes required for business continuity communications.
          7. Establish a response structure that will enable timely warnings and communication to relevant stakeholders.

          Clear and effective communication channels should remain available to disseminate information to participants and stakeholders, assess and relay damage, and coordinate a recovery strategy. Failed communication often results in failed business continuity efforts. Thorough planning, testing, and exercising communication procedures within the following four phases are essential to support effective business continuity and the viability of critical business operations.

          Implementation of backups and/or other means of data preservation (e.g., replication) should follow the following guidelines.

          1. The scope, frequency, and duration of cloud data retention should comply with:Applicable lawsContractual agreements with the cloud customersThe cloud provider’s business requirements

          1. The backup approach, including the physical location of backup files, should comply with the privacy and data protection laws and regulations applicable to the data collected.
          2. The data backup process should be monitored by employing technical and organizational safeguards. At a minimum, malfunctions should be examined and eliminated promptly by qualified employees to support compliance with the retention’s scope, frequency, and duration.
          3. Backup and restoration procedures should be periodically tested and the results documented to ensure data can be successfully restored. Tests should be designed so that the reliability of the backup media and the restoration time (RPO, RTO) can be established with sufficient certainty. Any errors and identified improvements (corrective and preventive actions) should be addressed promptly.
          4. Restorations should be carried out only after they have been approved by authorized persons (according to contractual agreements with cloud customers or the internal policies of the cloud provider).
          5. The cloud service provider, when appropriate, should be able to disclose the exercise results to the cloud services customer as part of the assurance of business continuity and resilience.

          Additional guidance is also available in the NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Rev. 4) CP-9 INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP (latest revision).

          Key audit is the process of assessing the organization, governance, infrastructure, policies, procedures, and activities.

          1. Audits assess compliance with "key management" policies and procedures.
          2. Audits assess the design and effectiveness of "key management" controls and the control environment.
          3. Audits assess compliance with industry and regulatory standards (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), payment card industry (PCI)).
          4. Audits results are reported to the key management system authority.
          5. Audits are performed according to key- and risk-management policies.
          6. Request third-party certification reports and review issues with the CSP and auditor.
          7. At a minimum, sensitive audit information and sensitive audit tools should be cryptographically protected.

In addition, the client may request verification that data has been effectively removed.

          These steps should include, but are not limited to:

          1. Removal of sensitive data or systems not regularly accessed by the organization, service provider, partner, etc. (stand-alone systems).
          2. Completion of a confidentiality assessment—including a verified process for select information sanitization and disposal processes.
          3. A record of the process should be documented and communicated to support decisions.
          4. All sanitized or destroyed assets should be logged into a tracking system with a certificate of media disposition (clear, purge, or destroy).

Personnel screening should consider all relevant privacy, PII protection, and employment-based legislation and should (when permitted) include the following:

          1. Availability of satisfactory references.
          2. Verification of the applicant’s curriculum vitae, including claimed academic and professional qualifications.

          4. Additional role-specific verifications, such as a credit review if the person will have fiscal responsibilities.The organization should consider rescreening individuals at regular intervals. Rescreening may also occur if the employee’s responsibilities or access to confidential data have increased since their last screening.The organization should have policies to determine who can screen personnel, how, when, and why the screening is required, where data is stored, and what the retention period constitutes.All relevant data about personnel should be considered PII and managed accordingly. If the screening is done by an external entity or another organizational department, sensitive information like historic remuneration details should be redacted if irrelevant to the screening process.

          4. Whiteboard and other types of displays should be cleared when not required.
          5. Computers should be configured to automatically lock the computer screen after an idle period (screen lock timeout).
          6. Users should be trained to log out of systems or lock computer screens when not at workstations.

          The organization should have procedures to vacate facilities, including conducting a final sweep before leaving to validate the organization's assets are not left behind (e.g., documents fallen behind drawers or furniture)

          - Using strong cryptography, all authentication credentials (such as passwords or phrases) should be rendered unreadable during transmission and storage on all system components.
          - Verify user identity before modifying any authentication credential (i.e., performing password resets, provisioning new tokens, or generating new keys).
          - Passwords/passphrases should meet the criteria of industry best practices.
          - Alternatively, the password/passphrases should have complexity and strength at least equivalent to the parameters specified above.
          - Change user passwords/passphrases per the organization password standard.
          - Limit password reuse per the organization password standard.
          - Set passwords/passphrases for first-time use and upon reset to a unique value for each user and change immediately after the first use.

          1. Guidance on selecting strong authentication credentials.
          2. Guidance for how users should protect their authentication credentials.
          3. Generic user IDs are disabled or removed.

          5. Shared and generic user IDs are not used to administer any system components.Guidance on selecting strong passwords may include suggestions to help personnel select hard-to-guess passwords that don’t contain:
          6. Dictionary words
          7. Information about the user (such as the user ID)
          8. Names of family members, date of birth, etc.

          Guidance for protecting authentication credentials may include not writing down passwords or saving them in insecure files and being alert for malicious individuals who may attempt to exploit their passwords (see NIST 800:53 password controls for details).

          Secure communication—when migrating physical servers, services, applications, or data to virtualized environments—could use a combination of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, source authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation.

          Building a secure channel of information transmission can be implemented at various network layers. Secure information transmission channels (ports and protocol) should be used such as : SSL, SSH, TLS operates at the application level, IPsec, ICMP at the network level, and PPTP, ARP are at the link layer.

          Only up-to-date versions for these protocols should be used (deprecated versions should not be used). Furthermore, only a secure port (e.g., 443) should be used.

          The organization should monitor and log all physical access via the following means:

          1. Verifying physical access of individuals when they enter secure areas.
          2. Maintaining physical access logs for the facilities
          3. Escorting visitors at all times.
          4. Reviewing access control logs regularly.

          The organization should use either video cameras or access control mechanisms (or both) to monitor individual physical access to sensitive areas. Review collected data, correlate with other entries, and store the data for at least three months (unless otherwise restricted by law.)

          The organization should implement physical and/or logical controls to restrict access to publicly accessible network jacks. For example, limit physical access to wireless access points, gateways, handheld devices, networking/communications hardware, and telecommunication lines.

          The organization should develop procedures to distinguish between onsite personnel and visitors with an emphasis on the following considerations:

          1. Identifying onsite personnel and visitors (for example, assigning badges)
          2. Changing access requirements
          3. Revoking or terminating onsite personnel and expired visitor identification

          The organization should develop procedures to control physical access for onsite personnel to sensitive areas as follows:

          1. Access should be authorized and based on individual job functions.
          2. Access should be revoked immediately upon termination. Furthermore, all physical access mechanisms, such as keys, access cards, etc., must be returned or disabled.

          Cloud service implementations involve an SSRM between the CSP and the CSC, which varies from service to service depending on the cloud service model and the specific implementation. Accordingly, CSPs should provide comprehensive SSRM guidance to facilitate secure CSC service implementations.

          Any CSP control responses should identify control applicability and ownership for their specific service.

          1. Cloud service provider-owned: CSP is fully responsible.
          2. Cloud service customer-owned: CSC is fully responsible.
          3. Third-party outsourced: The CSP has fully outsourced this control to a third party (e.g., a supporting CSP), but the CSP is fully accountable to the CSC for the third party's performance from a supply chain perspective.
          4. Shared CSP and CSC: Both the CSP and CSC have responsibilities (independent or dependent). If the CSP has partially outsourced control to a third party, that should be noted in the CSP implementation description.
          5. Shared CSP and third party: The CSP has partially outsourced control to a third party (e.g., a supporting CSP). Hence, the CSP and the third party have responsibilities—but the CSC has no responsibilities. The CSP is fully accountable to the CSC for the third party's performance from a supply-chain perspective.
          6. N/A: Not applicable to this specific cloud service offering (no SSRM responsibilities).

          Cloud service providers should also describe the following for each control (as appropriate) for its service and the specific ownership classification:

          1. Cloud service provider implementation description: How the CSP meets (or doesn't meet) the controls they are responsible for, wholly or partially. This should explain why N/A controls are not applicable for the specific service and describe the extent to which responsibility for particular controls is outsourced to third parties.
          2. Cloud service customer responsibilities: A detailed description of CSC security responsibilities for the controls the customer is responsible for, wholly or partially, with references and external links (as appropriate).

          The CSA's Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) should be used by CSPs to provide SSRM ownership and guidance to current and prospective CSCs. In cases where the CAIQ has multiple questions associated with a single control, CSPs should delineate SSRM ownership and describe how they meet their control requirements at the question level, aligned with the scope of the CSP CAIQ answer.

          A policy on threat and vulnerability management (TVM) should be established that includes the intent, purpose, and governance of how a CSP or CSC must address threats and vulnerabilities for their respective scope under the SSRM.

          At a minimum, the policy should specify:

          1. What should be covered under the scope, especially the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual requirements.
          2. The frequency of assessments.
          3. The methods that should be used.
          4. How and when assessments and significant vulnerabilities should be reported, including when it’s appropriate to share vulnerability information with customers and business partners.
          5. How reports should be reviewed.
          6. How actions to address relevant risks and opportunities should be tracked to closure.
          7. Approval of CSP native and (where applicable) third-party data/asset protection capabilities and relevant services for use by appropriate CSC authorities.
          8. A well-defined incident response process aligned with an organization's risk tolerance, accompanied by appropriate communication and notifications.
          9. Acceptable periods of remediation of threats in order of severity and criticality of computing infrastructure.
          10. Log review and correlation procedures with appropriate threat intelligence capabilities for log, events, metrics, and incidents (preferably through a centralized service).

          Malware protection policies should focus on inspecting both inbound and outbound traffic and implementing controls to detect, prevent, block, and remove malware. Include expectations of time objectives for remediation programs that seek to ensure systems are free of infection when they connect to enterprise computing resources. Malware protection should be integrated across all computing infrastructure, including compute, network, endpoints, and secure access gateways.

          Organizations should centrally manage malware protection mechanisms, including planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring organizational-defined malware protection security controls. This process will help to cohesively address malware within predefined timeframes.

          Threat and vulnerability management policy should include the ability to address malware as a specific threat element. This should provide the organization with a guideline to handle malware using appropriate tools, relevant automation, and operational frameworks to meet their risk tolerance.

          If malware is identified by antivirus or anti-malware applications using a signature- or behavior-based detection process, malware removal should be updated according to applicable contractual agreements and organizational standards. Additionally, prevention software and associated signatures should be deployed centrally by the service provider throughout their environment.

          4. Prohibit the circumvention of vendor-supported and integrated (built-in) security controls on endpoints (i.e., jailbreaking or rooting). Enforce these restrictions through detective and preventive controls on the endpoint, managed through a centralized system (e.g., an endpoint, system configuration control, or mobile device management system).

          3. The use of encryption for the entire device or data identified as non-public on all endpoints (enforced through technology controls).
          4. Each endpoint device should be assigned to a named person who is responsible for it. Such devices may be shared (e.g., in shared work areas), but a single individual should still be assigned responsibility for it.
          5. Non-device endpoints should also have "owners" responsible for assessing risks and ensuring appropriate controls.
          6. Endpoints should be vetted for policy compliance before being provisioned for organizational use.

          For managed endpoints, universal policy enforcement through one or more centralized configuration management tools is essential. Note: "Universal" enforcement is not necessarily "unified." Some vendors claim to offer "unified endpoint management" systems, but none are truly capable of managing all security features of all endpoint types.

          For unmanaged endpoints, guidance should be provided but will not be enforced (by definition).

          Based on risk assessment, different configurations may be acceptable for systems access and/or information storage—resulting in various degrees of end-points management with different access requirements. These may include using container technology for sensitive data isolation. For example, an organization that prohibits using electronic mail for sensitive information may determine that access to company electronic mail using a personally-owned device requires only limited controls (such as an acceptable passcode, a lock screen, reasonably up-to-date software, and no circumvention of vendor security controls [such as jailbreaking or rooting]).

          Personnel security requirements should be established and documented—including security roles and responsibilities for third-party providers coordinated and aligned with internal security roles and responsibilities. Monitor providers for compliance.

          Additionally, the organization should have a screening process for contractors and third-party users. When organizations provide contractors, the contract should specify the organization's responsibilities for screening and relevant notification procedures if screening has not been completed (or if the results cause doubts or concerns). Similarly, third-party agreements should specify all responsibilities and notification procedures for screening.

          Third-party providers should notify a designated individual or role (e.g., a member of the contracting or supply chain function) of any personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials, badges, or have information system privileges.

          Formal contracts should be employed that, at a minimum, specify:

          1. The covered information’s confidential nature and value.
          2. The security measures to be implemented and/or complied with. These include the organization's information security requirements and appropriate controls required by applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidance, and third-party access limitations.
          3. The service levels to be achieved in the services provided.
          4. The format and frequency of reporting to the organization's information security management forum.
          5. The arrangement for representation of the third party in appropriate organizational meetings and working groups.
          6. The arrangements for third-party compliance auditing.
          7. The penalties exacted if any of the preceding specifications fail.

          Mutually agreed-upon provisions and/or terms should be established to satisfy customer (tenant) requirements for service-to-service application (API), information processing interoperability, portability for application development and information exchange, usage, and integrity persistence.
